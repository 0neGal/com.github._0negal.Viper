# Viper

Viper is a launcher and updater for [Northstar](https://github.com/R2Northstar/Northstar), and not much more than that.

The Flatpak version simply takes the upstream AppImage and repacks it inside a Flatpak sandbox.

The repository for Viper can be found [here](https://github.com/0neGal/viper).
